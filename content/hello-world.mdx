# Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is my first post written in **MDX**.

## What is MDX?

MDX lets you use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components and embed them alongside your text.

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next

I'll be writing about:

- Web development
- Programming concepts
- Things I learn along the way

Stay tuned for more posts!
