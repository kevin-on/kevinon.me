  draft: true,
}

This is a test post to verify markdown styling. It includes **bold text**, _italic text_, and **_bold italic_** combinations. You can also use `inline code` within paragraphs.

## Headings

### This is an H3 heading

#### This is an H4 heading

##### This is an H5 heading

## Paragraphs and Text

Here's a regular paragraph with enough text to wrap across multiple lines. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence demonstrates how body text flows and wraps in the article layout.

This is a second paragraph to show spacing between paragraphs. Notice the margin between this and the previous paragraph.

## Code

### Inline Code

Use the `console.log()` function to debug. The `useState` hook is essential in React.

### Code Block

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`
}

const user: User = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Kevin",
  email: "kevin@example.com",
}

console.log(greetUser(user))
```

### Code Block with Different Language

```python
def fibonacci(n: int) -> int:
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)

for i in range(10):
    print(fibonacci(i))
```

### Plain Code Block

```
This is a plain code block
without syntax highlighting.
Just monospace text.
```
